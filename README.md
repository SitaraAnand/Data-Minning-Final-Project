Datacleaner.py is the data cleanser and data preparer and is run separately since we used a large dataset it takes significant amont of time 
The clusterAnalsis.py is the main program that creates the analysis. 
The data size is almost 1TB in size,  so it should be downloaded from the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/uber-eats-usa-restaurants-menus source
